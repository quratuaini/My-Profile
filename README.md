## About Me
Hi I'm Aini! I'm a self-motivated data enthusiast. My journey in data started during my final year of college, where I took a topic on data science for my thesis. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

In my spare time, I learned a lot about Data Analyst. To practice my skills, I tried many projects in data analyst using SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills and track my progress in Data Analyst related topics.
